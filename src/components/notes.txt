Notes By Bharath Boyapati 
React Developer 



In the updated version of react-router dom we are not using the switch 
and the switch is replaced by the Routes 

The syntax is given below 

This is how we are importing the BrowserRouter,Routes,Route

This is the updated syntax 
import {BrowserRouter,Route,Routes,} from "react-router-dom";

The old way of writing is 
import {BrowserRouter,Route,Switch,} from "react-router-dom";

Just the switch is replaced by the Routes 


In the updated verson of 6 we cant use the component the component is replaced by the elemenet
an the synatx has been completly changed 

The old way of writing is 

<Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />

In the component we are directly rendering the HomePage Elememnt 

But in the updated syntax we are going to use the element instaed of component

<Route path="/" element={<HomePage/>} exact />

And for the component we have to enclose with the Angular Braces 

The syntax is as follows

element={<HomePage/>} 


If we are not enclosing with the anguar braces we will be getting an error like this 

matched-leaf-route-at-location-does-not-have-an-element by default it will show the null page
